# ðŸŒŒ What is science
In short, science is the pursuit and collection of knowledge â€” of all kinds.
> The word **science** comes from the Latin "scientia", which means **knowledge** or **understanding**. 

When we're studying life, we call it biology â€” the science of life. Biology is a life science, focused on understanding how living things work, grow, and interact.

To make this large amount of knowledge concrete, we rely on observation, experimentation, and reasoning. Thatâ€™s what makes science different from just guessing â€” itâ€™s based on evidence.

## Are software engineers scientists
- A scientist creates a new material â†’ an engineer uses it to build something.
- An engineer develops a new tool â†’ a scientist uses it to discover something new.
> Often, the same person does both, cycling between theory and application; however, developing simple things (like web applications or general software) doesn't make you a scientist. You can be a computer science student, but not a computer scientist â€” unless you're contributing new discoveries to the field.

# ðŸ’¾ Computer Science
Computer science is one of many branches of science. When you're studying computer science â€” also known as CS â€” you're diving into the vast body of knowledge weâ€™ve built around computers and computation.

We study and improve our understanding of computers so we can develop solutions using computational technology. The main goal is to automate the resolution of real-world problems through a structured process, which can be summarized as follows:
1. Colect data (inputs)
2. Process the data (using algorithms)
3. Generate results (outputs)

## Humans follow the same structured process as computers: input â†’ process â†’ output
We often think of computers as the only ones that follow a structured pattern to solve problemsâ€”but this model actually comes from us, human beings.

Take conversations, for example. When someone asks us a question, we receive it as input. We think about itâ€”that's our brain doing the processingâ€”and then we give an answer: the output.

Here's a simple example:
- [Your friend]: "Where is your dog?"
- [You]: "He's in my apartment."

From your friend's perspective, the question is an outputâ€”they're sending information out. For you, it's an input. Your brain processes the question and quickly finds the answer, which becomes your output, sent back as a response.


Itâ€™s literally the same structure that computers use:
```
    Input â€“ You receive data (the question).

    Process â€“ You think about the data.

    Output â€“ You come up with and send the answer.
```
